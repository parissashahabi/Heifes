Designed and developed Heifes, an e-commerce website utilizing Next.js, which connects customers with stores possessing excess unsold food. To ensure adherence to software engineering principles, the project was managed using the Scrum framework, and all essential UML diagrams, including DCD and sequence diagrams, were fully crafted.
Tested the website's functionality and reliability by conducting over 15 test cases with Jest, resulting in an overall coverage rate of 60%, and utilized Cypress to compose four integration test scenarios.
